\section*{Problem} How many proper factors does one billion have?  A
\emph{proper factor} of a positive integer $n$ is a positive integer $m$ such
that $n = km$ where $k$ is a positive integer greater than $1$ and less than
$n$.

\section*{Solution} $10^9 = 2^9 \mathord{\cdot} 5^9.$  Every proper factor of
$10^9$ must have the form $2^m \mathord{\cdot} 5^n$ where $m$ and $n$ are
between $0$ and $9$.  The two combinations $m = n = 0$ and $m = n = 9$ must be
excluded, but all others are valid and distinct factors.  They are all distinct
because $2$ and $5$ are primes (so two different products of them to different
exponents cannot be the same, by uniqueness of prime factorization).  Therefore,
there are exactly $10 \mathord{\cdot} 10 - 2 = 98$ proper factors of one
billion.
