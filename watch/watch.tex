\section*{Problem}
Moe’s wife Mathilda got him a cool watch like the one shown below for Christmas.  He complained that without any hash marks for minutes, he could never tell exactly what time it was.  Matty said that a few minutes after the time in the picture, he could tell exactly what time it is – when the hands make a straight line.  What time will that be?

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

\section*{Bonus}
What is the formula for the minutes after the hour $h$ when the hands will make a straight line for $h$ between 6 and 11?

\newpage
\section*{Solution}
Let $\alpha$ be the angle (in radians) between the vertical (12 o'clock) and the position of the minute hand at time $t$ minutes after $8$.  So for example at $15$ minutes after the hour, $\alpha = \pi/4$ or in general, since $t$ is measured in minutes,  $\alpha = 2{\pi}t/60.$  Now for the hour hand to make a vertical line with the minute hand, it has to be $\pi$ more radians around the clock, which means it has to be at $2{\pi}t/60 + \pi.$  Now we know that at exactly $8$, the hour hand's position is $2{\pi}8/12 = 4{\pi}/3$ and we know that after $t$ minutes it will be $2\pi/12 \times t/60$ radians further along the circle.  (It has to make it one twelfth of the way around the circle in 60 minutes.) So to find  time $t$ when the straight line alignment happens, we just have to solve $$4\pi/3 +  (2\pi/12 )(t/60) = 2{\pi}t/60 + \pi.$$  Solving that for $t$ gives 10.90909..., which translates to 8:10:55 (rounding 54.5454 seconds to 55).

\section*{Bonus Solution}
Replacing 8 with $h$ in the formula for $\alpha$ above results in the general solution  $$t = {\dfrac {(h - 6)60}{11}}$$
