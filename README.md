## All Hands Problems

These are problems that I have used in All Hands meetings over the last few years. I present a problem at the beginning of each meeting and ask for solutions at the end.  The problems are desigined to be solvable in a short time without advanced mathematics or complex computations. Some require calculus and some require knowledge or invention of some elementary combinatorics, but most are doable with high-school level math. 

## Usage


Each directory contains the files associated with a problem. The .tex file contains the source used to generate the .pdf, possibly also using some other resource files in the problem direcory.  In a few cases, there are also subdirectories containing source code.

## Bugs, comments, contributions

Thanks in advance for any improvements, especially correcting errors.  Fixes can be  submitted in Github Pull Requests or the GitHub issue tracker can be used to report errors or to suggest improvements.

New problem contributions are also welcome.  Problems should be submitted as LaTex documents, including supporting files.  Contributors must be able to contribute the problems under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0 and all contributions are assumed to be made under these terms.
