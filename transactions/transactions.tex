\section*{Problem}
Moe's revolutionary ``oreo design" hotel has become so successful that his VBA-powered MSFT Access CRS is having trouble handling the transaction volume coming at it when both of his room service / sales agents (Huey and Looey) take calls at the same time.  The system doesn't have any logging and doesn't store enough info to count transactions, but Joe found a way to sample counts of transactions per hour throughout the day.  Using his Colorado City HS AP Stats training, Joe estimated a polynomial regression model from the data and came up with the following model for the rate of incoming transactions per hour (in thousands) as a function of time over the period when Huey and Looey answer the phone (between 2 and 6 in the afternoon):
$$r(t) = -t^2 +8t - 12$$
where t is measured in hours starting at $t = 2$ and ending at $t = 6$.  How many total transactions should Moe expect to receive between 2 and 6?

\newpage
\section*{Solution}
$\int_{2}^{6}{-t^2 + 8t - 12}dt = \left[x^3/3 + 4x^2 - 12x\right]_2^6 = 32/3$ thousand transactions.
